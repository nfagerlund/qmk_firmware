# nick's lefty-wasd

WASD arrows and the surrounding keys most often used in first-person games, in a
semi-reversed layout for people who mouse with their left hand. (So the E key is
still "up one row with the index finger," for example.) Had to cram some keys
into odd places due to the narrow hardware, and numbers above 3 require hitting
two keys at once, but it's working pretty good for me.

I don't feel like keeping this ascii art up to date, sorry!
